CA1 Assignment 
You are hired as a network engineer for LT Network
Solutions, a mid-sized enterprise with a five-floor office building.
Each floor is equipped with 10 computers, and the organization
requires a well-structured network to ensure efficient communication
and scalability.
Network Design Requirements:
1. Topology Selection: Design a ring topology for first two floors,
mesh topology for next two floors, and star topology for remaining
floors, considering performance and fault tolerance.
2. IP Addressing Scheme: The company has decided to use Class A
private IPv4 addresses for first three floors and then Class B
public IPv4 addresses for remaining floors following a classful
addressing scheme. Allocate IP addresses properly for each floor,
ensuring uniqueness.
3. Routing Strategy for Inter-Floor Communication &
Connectivity: Recommend a routing approach that is static for
inter-floor communication.
 Design how the floors will be connected for seamless inter-
department communication.
 Suggest the appropriate network devices (e.g., switches,
routers, access points) and their placement.
 If using dynamic routing, suggest an appropriate routing
protocol (e.g., RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP) with justification.
 If using static routing, define the static routes for efficient data
flow.
 Specify the number of default gateways along with IP
addresses.
